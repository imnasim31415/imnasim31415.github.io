Well, the journey that started after my HSC in 2017 has finally come to an end. Five years and three months, to be specific. It's been one heck of a roller coaster ride. There were moments when I felt so blessed to be at JU, and other times I felt cursed by the chaos it put me through.



The first year was full of memories, though I feel awkward about most of them now. I was too blind to see things clearly. I was too busy getting myself involved in almost everything and everywhere. Then Covid happened. It truly helped me come to terms with reality. Whatever that was, I genuinely cherish those days and wish I could start them all over again.

During my second and third years, I spent most of my time feeling numb. I tried to make an academic comeback in my third year but ultimately gave up on it. The final year, however, brought me so many rewards. Life took a strong turnaround. I got involved in a relationship (still going strong), went to two regional contests, took coding classes for the juniors, and had the chance to do some quality projects as well.

My academic performance was mostly average. I could and should have done better, and I feel bad about it. Throughout my life, I never studied much at home. What I did was always pay close attention in class. But coming to university, I felt like I had lost focus. I felt so sad that I couldn't concentrate on my classes anymore. Somehow, I am done with the degree now, and that's all that matters. Academics are important because they demonstrate that you can be serious about your work when necessary.

Looking back at my uni life now, I’m super grateful. Alhamdulillah. Juggling life between Gazipur, campus, and Uttara was tough, but it’s been a journey of finding a place to belong. Balancing studies, tuition, programming, family responsibilities, and being in a relationship wasn't easy. I’m happy that I won’t have to stress about whether I'll be in JU or Gazipur the next day, and I’m definitely glad I won’t have to deal with that terrible Ashulia-CnB road anymore.

As I move forward, I'm taking all the lessons and memories with me. I'm thankful for all the experiences, good and bad, because they've shaped who I am today. I believe this journey has prepped me for whatever comes next. Here's to new beginnings and hoping the future brings even better things.
